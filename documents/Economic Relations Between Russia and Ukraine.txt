The economic relationship between Russia and Ukraine has been historically intertwined, shaped by trade, energy dependence, and shared industries. Ukraine relies heavily on Russian gas for energy, while Russia benefits from Ukrainian agricultural exports. However, political tensions have strained these economic ties, particularly after the 2014 annexation of Crimea. Sanctions and trade restrictions have led to a significant decline in bilateral trade, impacting both economies. Ukraine has sought to diversify its energy sources and strengthen ties with the European Union, reducing dependence on Russian resources. As the two nations navigate their complex economic interdependence, finding a balance between cooperation and sovereignty remains a critical challenge for Ukraineâ€™s economic future.
