Russia is endowed with vast natural resources, playing a crucial role in its economy. The country is one of the world's largest producers of oil and natural gas, significantly influencing global energy markets. This resource wealth has driven economic growth but also created vulnerabilities, as the economy heavily depends on energy exports. Russia's geopolitical strategies often revolve around securing its energy interests, particularly in Europe and Asia. The exploitation of mineral resources, such as diamonds and gold, further contributes to the economy. However, over-reliance on natural resources poses challenges, including economic diversification and environmental sustainability. Balancing resource management with economic resilience is vital for Russia's long-term stability.
