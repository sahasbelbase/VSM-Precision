Russia-Ukraine War, war between Russia and Ukraine that began in February 2014 with the covert invasion of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea by disguised Russian troops. The conflict expanded in April 2014 when Russians and local proxy forces seized territory in Ukraine’s Donbas region; over the next seven years, more than 14,000 people would be killed in fighting in eastern Ukraine.

On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Although Russian forces made significant gains in the first days of combat, Ukrainian defenders rebuffed attempts to seize Kyiv and other major cities and were soon launching counterattacks at Russian positions.
The toppling of the Yanukovych government and the invasion of Crimea
From November 2013 to late February 2014, protesters gathered on Kyiv’s Maidan Nezalezhnosti (“Independence Square”) in a series of demonstrations that came to be known as the Euromaidan. Those protests involved several distinct stages, culminating in the removal of Pres. Viktor Yanukovych, which in turn precipitated a violent separatist movement in the eastern regions of the country.

In late November 2013 Yanukovych had signaled his willingness to sign an association agreement with the European Union. In return, the Europeans demanded that he release opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko from prison and initiate constitutional and legal reforms. After a visit with Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Yanukovych opted not to sign the agreement. It seemed that Ukraine would commit itself to the Eurasian Economic Union, a Russian-led EU analogue that would include Kazakhstan and Belarus as members when it came into existence on January 1, 2015.
