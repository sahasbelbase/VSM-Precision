The Cold War significantly influenced the relationship between Russia and Ukraine. As part of the Soviet Union, Ukraine experienced political and cultural suppression, shaping its national identity. The rivalry between the East and West also affected Ukraine's position, as it became a focal point in geopolitical strategies. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine sought independence and the establishment of a sovereign identity. However, historical ties to Russia complicated this process, leading to ongoing tensions. The legacy of the Cold War continues to resonate in contemporary conflicts, with issues of territorial integrity and national sovereignty at the forefront of Russia-Ukraine relations.
